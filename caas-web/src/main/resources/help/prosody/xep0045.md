* Make sure your server is v0.3+
* Follow the instructions at [chat room documentation](https://prosody.im/doc/chatrooms)
* If your chat rooms are not located directly as a subdomain of the server's primary
domain, you should add a [disco\_items option](https://prosody.im/doc/modules/mod_disco)
to your virtual host that contains the domain of your MUC component.

* Make sure your server has v0.9+
* Add the community module [mod\_http\_upload](https://modules.prosody.im/mod_http_upload) or [mod\_http\_upload\_external](https://modules.prosody.im/mod_http_upload_external.html)
* Follow the instructions from the module documentation to set up HTTP upload server
* If your upload component is not located directly as a subdomain of the server's primary
domain, you should add a [disco\_items option](https://prosody.im/doc/modules/mod_disco)
to your virtual host that contains the domain of your upload component.

Note: This module does not come with default prosody installation.
However, it can be set up by adding a community module.
To learn about how to install a community module, go to [installing modules documentation](https://prosody.im/doc/installing_modules)

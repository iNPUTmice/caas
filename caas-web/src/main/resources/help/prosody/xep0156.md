Look at the [Examples Section](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0156.html#httpexamples) of XEP-0156 and create appropriate files for your server. Only one of `host-meta` and `host-meta.json` is required to pass this test. However it is recommended to create both.

To pass this test the host-meta files should additionally have [`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0156.html#impl) response header so that the file contents can be read by web clients.

Nginx: Example code to add to server block:

```
location /.well-known/host-meta {
    default_type 'application/xrd+xml';
    add_header Access-Control-Allow-Origin '*' always;
}

location /.well-known/host-meta.json {
    default_type 'application/jrd+json';
    add_header Access-Control-Allow-Origin '*' always;
}
```

Apache: Example code to add to `conf/httpd.conf` file:

```
<Location ~ "/\.well-known/host-meta(\.json)?">
    Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
</Location>
```
If you're using the built-in Prosody web server, you can instead load the community module [mod_http_altconnect](https://modules.prosody.im/mod_http_altconnect.html), which creates the needed files automatically.
